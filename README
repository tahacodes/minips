how it works?

PID column:
    - just ls the /proc and grep it with [0-9] regex.

executed file path:
    - fist of all we have to check if any file exists in /proc/{pid}/exe.
    - then just print out the file its linked to using readlink utility.

files opened by specific proccecc:
    - there's multiple files in /proc/{pid}/fd/* directory.
    - walk through those files using a for loop and print out where are they pointed to, again using readlink.

why did i handled non-existing "$(readlink -f /proc/${PID}/exe)"?
    - when you execute this script on some special distros like docker-desktop on wsl2 you'll see that there's a few PIDs which aren't linked to any exec files, also they're not opening any files either.
